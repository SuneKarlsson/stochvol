# stochvol

This is the development repository of the
[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) package
[`stochvol`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stochvol). The package
provides methods to estimate the stochastic volatility model,
potentially with conditionally heavy tails and/or with leverage. Using
functions `svsample`, `svtsample`, `svlsample`, and `svtlsample`, one
can conduct Bayesian inference on \(\mu\).

## Install CRAN Version

Type into your `R` session:

``` r
install.packages("stochvol")
```

For more information, please visit the [CRAN
page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stochvol) of the package.

## Install Latest Development Version

Type into your `R` session:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "https://github.com/gregorkastner/stochvol")
```
